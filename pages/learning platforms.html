        <h1>Programming Learning Terms</h1>
        <p>
          As it is the case for any skill, it is essential to learn the basic
          terms used in that domain before going full-fledged into practice
          mode. Knowing terms help you understand your domain better and faster.
          If you are learning to code or new to computer science, we bring a few
          important computer science and programming terms to you that can act
          as your learning 101 guide. We have also added relevant links for
          every definition so that you can learn more if you want to dig deeper.
        </p>
        <h3>PROGRAMMING TERMS AND DEFINITIONS</h3>
        <h4>1- ALGORITHM</h4>
        <p>
          An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules designed to solve a
          definite problem. The problem can be simple like adding two numbers or
          a complex one, such as converting a video file from one format to
          another.

        <h4>2- PROGRAM</h4>
        <p>
          A computer program is termed as an organized collection of
          instructions, which when executed perform a specific task or function.
          A program is processed by the central processing unit (CPU) of the
          computer before it is executed. An example of a program is Microsoft
          Word, which is a word processing application that enables users to
          create and edit documents. The browsers that we use are also programs
          created to help us browse the internet.

        <h4>3- API</h4>
        <p>
          Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules, routines,
          and protocols to build software applications. APIs help in
          communication with third party programs or services, which can be used
          to build different software. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter
          actively use APIs to help developers gain easier access to their
          services.

        <h4>4- ARGUMENT</h4>
        <p>
          Argument or arg is a value that is passed into a command or a
          function. For example, if SQR is a routine or function that returns
          the square of a number, then SQR(4) will return 16. Here, the value 4
          is the argument. Similarly, if the edit is a function that edits a
          file, then in edit myfile.txt, ‘myfile.txt’ is the argument.

        <h4>5- BOOLEAN</h4>
        <p>
          A Boolean expression or Boolean logic is an expression used for
          creating statements that are either TRUE or FALSE. Boolean expressions
          use AND, OR, XOR, NOT and NOR operators with conditional statements in
          programming, search engines, algorithms, and formulas. Boolean
          expressions are also called comparison expressions, conditional
          expressions, and relational expressions.
